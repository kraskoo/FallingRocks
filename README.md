# FallingRocks - Object Oriented Project

This project contains first of series planned tries for developing game engine on abstract level, which it should be used on different environments.
The Design should be follow sample of my main idea, which could be changed at this level.
Purpose of these tries are to shows what future problems supposed to be expected.
This project shows some logic problems, which could have some mainly problems for refactoring, but at this level I've choise to ignore them.
Nevertheless the game is finished and works. Supports play and menu modes, with additional options for upgrades.
Play Ð¼ode doesn't fit exactly in this case.
Still have work on levels and player's death. But have playable state.
